In this experiment, we will see how multicast routing protocols can be used to mitigate delay in blockage-prone mmWave networks. It should take about 90 minutes to run this experiment.

This experiment runs on the CloudLab testbed. To reproduce this experiment on Cloudlab, you will need an account on [Cloudlab](href="https://cloudlab.us/), you will need to have [joined a project](https://docs.cloudlab.us/users.html#%28part._join-project%29), and you will need to have [set up SSH access](https://docs.cloudlab.us/users.html#%28part._ssh-access%29).


## Background
